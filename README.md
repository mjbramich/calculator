# Calculator
This is a simple calculator project that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

## How Tt's Made:

**Tech Used:** The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Firstly started doing all my HTML and CSS to visually get the calculator spot and so i had something to work off.
From there i started working through all the logic involved in making a calculator. Creating the operations was easy, but getting the logic correct was hard

During the project, I had difficulty using flexbox to size all of the items. I typically use fixed measurements, but I made an effort to size the items based on the available space. Additionally, I struggled to get the buttons to be a perfect square without using fixed measurements. However, I discovered the aspect ratio property, which helped me solve the problem.




## Optimizations

The project was optimized by adding a backspace button  The backspace button is a useful addition as it allows the user to quickly correct any mistakes without having to clear the entire calculation. 
The use of floating-point numbers provides greater flexibility when performing calculations, as it allows for decimal points to be included.


## Lessons Learned

    * Using flexbox to size items instead of fixed units
    * Finding and using the aspect-ratio property to get even squares for the buttons
    * Importance of planning and psuedo-coding before diving into coding
    * Understanding and implementing the correct logic for a calculator, including the order of operations and how to handle input from the user
    * Importance of testing and debugging code thoroughly to ensure proper functionality
    * Enhancing visual appeal through CSS styling and creating a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.
